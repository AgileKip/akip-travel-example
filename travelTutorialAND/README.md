# TravelTutorial

An example on how to automate a simple process with AND gateways using the AgileKip Platform.

In this example we use the AND or Parallel gateway, this gateway allow to work in more than one activity at the same time (in parallel), that means you need to complete the user task Rent a car as well as Book a hotel user task to proceed and finish this BPMN. In order when you run this example you'll fill the start form to pass to the next user task, the Buy flight tickets, than you reach the parallel gateway with the two user tasks.
