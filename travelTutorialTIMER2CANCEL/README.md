# TravelTutorial

An example on how to automate a simple process with an Interrupting Timer Event to Cancel a process using the AgileKip Platform.

In this example the objective is to demonstrate the use of a timer within a subprocess, a timer will be activated within the time defined in it, can be used as a start event, intermediate event or border event, threshold events can be stopped or not.

In this case, after completing the start form in order to test the timer you must wait 1 minute and then the process will be cancelated.
