# TravelTutorial

An example on how to automate a simple process and tweak the UX (Vue Code) using the AgileKip Platform.

This is the most simple example, we only need to register before execute any process the Airline Company, Car Company and the Hotel Company, than you initiate the Start Form, and the upcoming tasks, Buy flight tickets, Book a hotel and Rent a car to finish the process, this will help to demonstrate how we can automate a process.
The only difference between the TravelTutorialENTITIES for this, is that we have in the example an ajustment of the UX of the Book a hotel inputs.
