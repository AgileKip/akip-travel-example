# TravelTutorial

An example on how to automate a simple process with Interrupting Timer Event using the AgileKip Platform.

In this example, the objective is to demonstrate the use of a timer within a simple process, a timer will be activated within the time defined in it, can be used as a start event, intermediate event or border event, threshold events can be stopped or not.

In this case, after activating the timer, the process will go to an event that ends the process.
