# TravelTutorial

An example on how to automate a simple process with a CALL Activity using the AgileKip Platform.

In this example, a parallel activity is called to cancel the travel plan, for this it is necessary to complete the task of buying airline tickets and arrive at the task of booking a hotel. There is a two minute timer that the user must complete within the established time, otherwise the flow will go to a parallel activity, if the task is completed the process will continue at the gateway to decide whether to rent a car or end the process.
